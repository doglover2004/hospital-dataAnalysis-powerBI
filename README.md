              #POWER BI HOSPITAL RECORDS 
1. Project Overview
•	Project Title: Hospital Records Analytics Dashboard
•	Developed By: Krishna kumar S
Purpose:
-The purpose of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze hospital patient data to derive insights into patient outcomes, satisfaction, cost distribution, length of stay, and readmission rates. This analysis helps stakeholders identify areas of improvement in healthcare services and cost management.

DATASET USED
- <a href="https://github.com/doglover2004/hospital-dataAnalysis-powerBI/blob/main/hospital%20data%20analysis%20(1).csv"> DATASET</a>

3. Key Metrics & KPIs
-•	Average Cost: 8.37K
•	Average Length of Stay: 37.66 days
•	Average Satisfaction: 3.60
•	First Readmission Rate: No (No patient readmitted first time in this filter)

4.Dashboard Visualizations

-TREEMAP - Cost by Procedure	Displays the total cost distribution across different procedures (e.g., Surgery, Angioplasty, CT Scan).
-PIE CHART - Readmission	Shows the proportion of patients readmitted. 73.17% were readmitted.
-BAR CHART - Length of Stay by Condition	Compares total hospital stay duration across medical conditions.
-BAR CHART - Cost by Condition	Highlights cost-heavy conditions like Cancer, Prostate issues, and Heart Diseases.
-DONUT CHART - Gender Distribution	53% Male, 46% Female.
-BAR CHART - Age Distribution	Patient count distribution across age groups (20–80 years).
-BAR CHART - Satisfaction by Outcome	Higher satisfaction scores are linked with recovered patients.

5. Insights & Observations
#•	Cancer treatments are among the most expensive and also have longer hospital stays.
#•	The readmission rate is high (73%), which may indicate treatment gaps or premature discharge.
#•	Patients with recovered outcomes tend to have higher satisfaction compared to those marked as stable.
#•	Cost by procedure is highest for Surgery and Chemotherapy.
#•	Gender distribution is fairly balanced, with a slight male majority.


6. Final Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a complete and data-driven view of hospital performance. It clearly highlights patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment procedures, costs, satisfaction levels, and outcomes.

Key metrics such as average cost, average satisfaction, and length of stay help understand both patient experience and operational efficiency. The visual charts allow easy comparison across conditions, procedures, and genders. With interactive filters, the dashboard supports quick decision-making and helps identify areas where the hospital can improve patient care, reduce treatment costs, and enhance overall service quality.
